  """
    builds a library given required scripts to includes and other arguments
    accepted URL arguments:

    require - a comma separated list of *files* to require; can also be specified in the php style as "require[]=foo&require[]=bar"
    requireLibs - a comma separated list of *libraries* to require - these are the names defined in our *congfig.json* in the *libs* section. So, for example, *requireLibs=mootools-core,mootools-more* using the default config would include both the complete inventories of MooTools Core and More. This can also be specified as a comma separated list or the php style (*requireLibs[]=mootools-core&requireLibs[]=mootools-more*).
    exclude - exactly like the *require* value, except it's a list of files to exclude. This is useful if you have already loaded some scripts and now you require another. You can specify the scripts you already have and the one you now need, and the library will return only those you do not have.
    excludeLibs - just like the *exclude* option but instead you can specify entire libraries.
    cache - if set to *true* you'll be returned a cached version of the script even if the server is set to *false* and vice versa.
    compression - you'll be returned the compression type you specify regardless of the server default. Note that if you specify a compression type that the server does not allow, you'll be returned which ever one it does. If it does not support compression at all, you will not be returned a compressed file. You can also specify "none" which is useful for development and debugging.
